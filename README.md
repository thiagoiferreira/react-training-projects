# Repository for Training React Code

This repository stores code that I developed for learning React Web development.
<br>
To run any project in this repository you will need Node.js installed in your machine, once you have that, due to the fact that node contains most packages necessary in react development you will be able to run the projects existant in this repo.
<br>
To run the projects do the following
<br>
``` Go into the desired project using the command line by typing cd 'project name' ```
<br>
```npm start```
```acess localhost:3000 on your browser```
